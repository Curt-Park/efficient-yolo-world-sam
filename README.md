## Core Componentes

### YOLO-World
YOLO-World is an open-vocabulary object detection model with high efficiency.
On the challenging LVIS dataset, YOLO-World achieves 35.4 AP with 52.0 FPS on V100,
which outperforms many state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and speed. 

### EfficientViT SAM
EfficientViT SAM is a new family of accelerated segment anything models.
Thanks to the lightweight and hardware-dfficient core building block,
it delivers 48.9Ã— measured TensorRT speedup on A100 GPU over SAM-ViT-H without sacrificing performance.
